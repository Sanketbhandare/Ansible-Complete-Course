Complete Ansible Zero to Hero Course with Real-Time Examples. Keep Learning!

---

### Course Requirements:
 1. **Laptop (with admin privileges)**
 2. **Desire to Learn**.

---

## **Module 1: Ansible Basics & Architecture**
- **Introduction to Ansible**: Automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.
- **Architecture**: Master (control node) and managed nodes (hosts).
- **Ansible Components**: Inventory, modules, playbooks, and tasks.

---

## **Module 2: Ansible Playbooks & Variables**
- **Playbooks**: YAML files that define automation tasks.
- **Variables**: Use variables for dynamic values in playbooks.
  - Declare and use variables in playbooks.
  - Facts: Collect system information during execution.

---

## **Module 3: Ansible Modules & Collections**
- **Modules**: Core building blocks for tasks (e.g., `yum`, `copy`, `service`).
- **Collections**: Reusable code packaged together, containing roles, modules, and plugins.

---

## **Module 4: Ansible Roles, Galaxy & Vault**
- **Roles**: Organize playbooks into reusable units.
- **Galaxy**: Download and share roles via Ansible Galaxy.
- **Vault**: Store sensitive data (passwords, keys) securely in playbooks.

---

## **Module 5: Error Handling & Debugging**
- **Error Handling**: Handle task failures using `ignore_errors`, `when`, and `block`.
- **Debugging**: Use the `debug` module to print variable values or task output for troubleshooting.

---

## **Module 6: Dynamic Inventories, CI/CD Integration**
- **Dynamic Inventories**: Automate host inventory using scripts or cloud plugins (AWS, Azure).
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate playbook execution within CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab).

---

## **Module 7: System Management**
- **Package Management**: Install, update, and remove software (e.g., `apt`, `yum`).
- **Service Management**: Manage system services (start, stop, restart) using Ansible modules.

---

## **Module 8: End-to-End Project**
1. **Step 1: Setup Inventory**:
   - Create static and dynamic inventories for managed hosts.
2. **Step 2: Write Playbooks**:
   - Write playbooks for installing a web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
   - Use variables for configuration.
3. **Step 3: Implement Roles**:
   - Organize playbooks into roles (e.g., `webserver`, `database`).
   - Download roles from Ansible Galaxy if necessary.
4. **Step 4: Use Vault**:
   - Securely manage sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys).
5. **Step 5: Error Handling & Debugging**:
   - Handle errors gracefully and use debugging for troubleshooting.
6. **Step 6: Integrate with CI/CD**:
   - Integrate playbook execution into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins) to deploy applications automatically.
7. **Step 7: System Management**:
   - Automate system setup tasks, including package installation and service management.
8. **Step 8: Final Testing & Deployment**:
   - Test the entire setup by executing playbooks and verify the automation pipeline.

---

## **Module 9: Final Project**
- **Automate Multi-Server Deployment**:
   - Deploy a multi-tier web application (web server + database).
   - Use Ansible to automate the deployment process, from configuration to maintenance.
   - Implement monitoring and logging, manage servers, and automate updates.
